        <p>Dua Lipa is a British popstar who sings and writes her own songs. She first
        started her music career in 2014 when she signed with Warner Records, an American
        record label owned by Warner Bros. She released her first single, "New Love," in 
        August 2015. She debuted her first album, <i>Dua Lipa</i>, in June 2017. This album 
        included the song "New Rules" which is her best-selling single ever released. It
        topped the UK's charts and was within the top ten of many other countries' charts
        including Australia (#2), the United States (#6), and Canada (#7) shortly after its
        release. Her second album, <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, was released in March 2020. The
        album peaked at the #1 spot on the Official UK Albums chart shortly after its release.
        Four of the album's songs were released as singles, two of which, "Don't Start Now"
        and "Levitating", reached the top ten of the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. <i>Future 
        Nostalgia</i> was the most streamed album by a woman and the fifth most streamed
        overall on Spotify in 2020. Dua Lipa released her third and most recent album, 
        <i>Radical Optimism</i>, in May 2024. Throughout her career, she has released many
        additional singles not featured on albums including collaborations with other artists
        and song contributions to films.
